    "A similar task to character-level text generation (but more complicated) is generating Shakespearean poems. Instead of learning from a dataset of dinosaur names, you can use a collection of Shakespearean poems. Using LSTM cells, you can learn longer-term dependencies that span many characters in the text--e.g., where a character appearing somewhere a sequence can influence what should be a different character, much later in the sequence. These long-term dependencies were less important with dinosaur names, since the names were quite short. \n",
